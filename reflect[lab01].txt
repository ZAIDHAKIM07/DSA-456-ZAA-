LAB 01 REFLECTIONS

While Python is a robust and versatile language, there are certain aspects that I found less favorable:

Performance: As an interpreted language, Python tends to be slower than compiled languages like C/C++. This can be a notable disadvantage for tasks demanding high performance.

Dynamic Typing: Although dynamic typing enhances Python's flexibility, it can result in runtime errors that would typically be caught during compilation in statically typed languages like C/C++. This can make the debugging process more difficult.

Indentation Sensitivity: Python's use of indentation to define code blocks can sometimes cause issues that are difficult to detect, particularly if there is an inadvertent mix of tabs and spaces.
